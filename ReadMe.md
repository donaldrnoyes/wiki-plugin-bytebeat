# Federated Wiki (experimental) - Bars Plugin

*This federated wiki plugin is part of an experimental code refactoring, which is very much a work in progress. See [WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki) (ruby), or [WardCunningham/wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/wiki) (node), for the current stable versions.*

The Bytebeat plugin generates 8 kHz sound samples by evaluating its own text as a c-like arithmetic expression in terms of t, the integer sample number.

Kragen Javier Sitaker has assembled a good introduction to the Bytebeat community [webpage](http://canonical.org/~kragen/bytebeat/) His own composition, *Crowd*, served as the score for the short film *Exploring Cyberspace*.
